# The Beginning Pt. 2

Before we get any further, the command to clear the console is "CTRL + L". It is super annoying to have a full console with stuff not relevant.

## Syntax and Errors
- First syntax rule to know: case matters. Capitalizing or leaving a command lowercase will change the command and won't get the result you want.
- Make sure you save the file you are writing your code in. The command is usually "CTRL + S" or "CMD + S".
- If you mess something up, it will give you a traceback, which will tell you the file and line of the error so you can go and fix it.
- Make sure to have both an opening and closing parenthesis. If you forget one it won't know where to begin or where to end.
- Can use either quotation marks or apostraphes to enclose a string, e.g. print("Hello, World") and print('Hello, World') would both work.
  - However, must match beginning and end punctuation otherwise it won't read it.
