# The Beginning Pt. 2

Before we get any further, the command to clear the console is "CTRL + L". It is super annoying to have a full console with stuff not relevant.

## Syntax and Errors
- First syntax rule to know: case matters. Capitalizing or leaving a command lowercase will change the command and won't get the result you want.
- Make sure you save the file you are writing your code in. The command is usually "CTRL + S" or "CMD + S".
- If you mess something up, it will give you a traceback, which will tell you the file and line of the error so you can go and fix it.
- Make sure to have both an opening and closing parenthesis. If you forget one it won't know where to begin or where to end.
- Can use either quotation marks or apostraphes to enclose a string, e.g. print("Hello, World") and print('Hello, World') would both work.
  - However, must match beginning and end punctuation otherwise it won't read it.

## Variables
- In python, everything you create is an object and you can label an object so that you can refer to it later in your program.
  - These labels you create are called <ins>variables</ins>. Variables allow you to refer to objects that have been created; they are object references.
- <ins>String Literal</ins>: a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed within single quotation marks. The following are examples of string literals: 'Hello, world!' 'He said, "Take it or leave it."'
- Variable Naming Rules:
  1. Can contain both letters and digits, but must begin with either a letter or an underscore.
  2. Remember that case matters, you can use upper case, but by convention we do not.
  3. They cannot be a Python keyword.
- To name a string literal, you put "variable_name = 'string literal'"
  - This form of naming is the conventional way for Python. It is often referred to as "snake case" (adorable).
