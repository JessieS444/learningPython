# Types and Branching

## Numeric
- All the information we have covered so far is referred to as data. Different things are different data types.
- <ins>Integers</ins>: whole numbers like 1. "int." for short.
  - (look I know what integers are but I am Afraid I will forget)
- You can multiply using an asterisk.
- The solution to any math problem that you enter into the python shell will be stored in the variable underscore.
  - So if you type `_`, then it will print the answer to the last equation.
- <ins>Floating-Point Number</ins>: aka "float." A non-integer number with a decimal point. This is a different data type than integers.
