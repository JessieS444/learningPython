# Types and Branching

## Numeric
- All the information we have covered so far is referred to as data. Different things are different data types.
- <ins>Integers</ins>: whole numbers like 1. "int." for short.
  - (look I know what integers are but I am Afraid I will forget)
- You can multiply using an asterisk.
- The solution to any math problem that you enter into the python shell will be stored in the variable underscore.
  - So if you type `_`, then it will print the answer to the last equation.
- <ins>Floating-Point Number</ins>: aka "float." A non-integer number with a decimal point. This is a different data type than integers.
  - Even whole numbers that display a decimal point are considered float. 4.0 is a float.
  - Needed for precision.
  - Need to be careful with this. Sometimes will get odd results. Example: 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 will give you the answer 5.551115123125783e-17 with is a negative exponent and is zero with seventeen zeros following it and then a five. Why? I have no idea.
- To round floats
