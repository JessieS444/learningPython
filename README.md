# Learning Python

I'm making this repository as a reference to myself as I try to learn python. I need to be at an intermediate level before the beginning of the fall semeser, so I have this summer to learn. Maybe if I don't find it too challenging I'll also be learning another coding language? I want to learn a lot to be able to broaden my career prospects.

This is my first time learning a coding language, so it'll be a process. I do have some roundabout experience with coding (as in I took an installation based class and it included some basic coding stuff, but it wasn't the focus and any advanced stuff was already written out for us). So I'm not fully in the dark, just mostly. If I'm in a dark shadowy alley, you can just see my foot poking out into the sun.
