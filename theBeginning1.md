# Beginning Python Lessons through Treehouse

## Welcome, Running Scripts, the Python Shell, and REPL

### Welcome:
- Python is a general purpose language, so it can be used to build just about anything.
- Who uses python and for what?
    - US Government uses it for statistical analysis and data visualization
    - Spotify, Evernote, OkCupid use it for personalized recommendations and artificial intelligence-based tasks.
    - Disney, Pixar, Lucasfilm, and others use python to provide more realistic effects in their movies.
    - YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, and the Onion use python.
    - Python can be used for face and speech recognition.
- Teacher's notes are attached to each video in Treehouse.


### Running Scripts:
- Text editors allow us space to write and edit code. GNU nano is a text editor. You write the code in a file.
- Different colors in code is called "syntax highlighting." Syntax is the rules of the language (just like in non-coding languages).
- <u>Script:</u> a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor. (according to techtarget.com)
    - <u>Script:</u> The file we are writing that the Python interpreter will use. (according to Treehouse)
    - Python programs are commonly called scripts. (according to realpython.com)
- <u>String:</u> a string is a sequence of characters encolsed between the quotation marks. Example: "Hello, World." (according to emory.edu)
- After writing code in a file, it is passed to a Python Interpreter, which reads it line by line and interpret the meaning from the written script. Then, it will perform the actions in the code or evaluate it.
- <u>Interpreter:</u> The program that will read and execute our script.
- <u>Console:</u> also known as a command prompt (Windows OS), powershell (Windows OS), terminal (Mac OS). A tool that sends low level commands to your Operating System (macOS / Windows / Linux).

- The above is the command prompt (aka cmd or cmd.exe) for the Treehouse workspace. The tilde (~) means that you're in your home directory and the slash (/) means that you're in that subfolder/subdirectory of the named workspace (in this case, that is treehouse). The command prompt (command line?) is where you can send commands to your operating system.
    - Directories are like folders in most operating systems.
- `ls` command: short for "list," this command lists directories and files in the OS.'

- We told the Python Interpreter to run our script by typing `python hello.py`. This ran the script in the hello.py file, which was `print("Hello, World")`. So, what appeared was "Hello, World":
